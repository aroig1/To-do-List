# To-do-List
For this mini-project, I made a Todo-list using html, css, and javascript. I used this 
project in order to get some more hands on experience with creating a more javascript 
heavy website. This Todo-list uses much more javascript than my personal website I made 
before this, despite it being much smaller. It uses the javascript to take what you typed
in the text box and create and store it as a list item. It also uses javascript to
toggle between the list items being checked or unchecked and adds the ability to remove
items as well as add them. This project will act as a stepping stone as it gave me basic
skills that I will be able to apply to more advanced javascript projects in the future.
